# Owl-University-Mobile-App
A university mobile app developed for students of a fictional university, Owl University.

The app was originally created to satisfy requirements for a native Android mobile development course specifiying the use of Android Studio, Java with XML, and an SQLite database. I chose to modify the app at a later point in the degree program to satisfy capstone requirements, which resulted in the development of several new features that are now included. 

The app's username and password for the login are both "admin".

The app features: 
- The ability to manually add academic terms, associated courses to those terms, and associated assessments and mentors to those courses.
- Push notifications
- Full CRUD functionality with a SQLite database
- A search feature for locating mentor contact information 
- Test database feature accessible to the user for verifying functionality
- Secure login screen utilizing the users table in the database.
